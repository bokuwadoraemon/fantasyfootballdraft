# Fantasy Football Live Draft Process Proposal

## TL;DR

> * Pretty much the same as last year
> * Generally do the right thing
> * Final decision determined by commissioners

## Draft Attributes

* Live draft
* Same scoring as last year
* Snake drafting order
* Draft positions to be determined on day of live draft. Each owner will draw a draft position out of a box. The order of the draw is the reversed order of last year's standings.  
* Upon drafting, an owner has one minute to decide and make a verbal announcement of a player to be drafted. If the owner cannot decide, the owner has two chances to call for an additional three minutes to decide. If the owner cannot decide, the draft will be [automatically decided](#auto-draft).  
* There will be two 10 minutes breaks during the live draft. One break will happen after round 4. Another break will happen after round 8. If the owners agree to proceed without a break, there will be no break. However, if all owners agree for a break, there will be additional breaks. 
* Owners will be provided with printouts of Yahoo's [Fantasy Football Draft Rankings]
* There are 14 possible roster positions

  1 QB 2 RB 2 WR 1 TE 1 W-R-T 1 DEF 5 BN 1 IR

  , but the live draft will consist of 13 selections per owner. 

## Auto-draft 

* For owners who are not present for the live draft or if an owner cannot decide within the allowed time, the draft will automatically take place by the commissioners. 
* Based on Yahoo's [Fantasy Football Draft Rankings], the commissioners will select the second highest or lower ranking player that will fill the position that best suits a team. 
* Optionally, a player can provide his own draft rankings and exclusion list and the commissioners will try to accommodate those requests as much as possible. Please provide the rankings and exclusion list to the commissioners via email. 
* The commissioners have two minutes to select a player based on the rankings and exclusion list (if provided by owner). If the commissioners run out of time, the second highest ranking player will be selected. 

## Feedback

All owner feedback are welcome and will be considered. The commissioners will generally make the right decision. 

## FAQ

**What the hell is "generally do the right thing"?**

There will be times when a particular action or decision is not in favor of a owner or a group of owners. Examples include accidentally dropping a player from a roster or owners performing an unfair trade. If all owners are in agreement, the commissioners will act upon the suggestion made by an owner or owners to resolve a situation. If owners are in disagreement, the commissioners will decide. 24 hours of silence will be considered as approval by owners since it is not practical to wait for an owner's response on every occasion.  

**How will commissioners make a final decision if the commissioners cannot agree?**

If an agreement cannot be reached after some deliberation, the commissioners will flip a coin.  

**Why does the Yahoo rankings link go somewhere else?**

The Yahoo rankings are powered by FantasyPros.

**How long will the live draft take?**

Since there will be 12 owner x 13 selections/owner = 156 selections, if all goes well the live draft will take about 3 hours, perhaps up to 4 hours.
